# Django--Analyser

A application with the basic signup and sign in functionality with the use of email verification facility to the newly registered users.

In this app you can upload CSV matching with a model SALE with the following description: -
1. prod_desc( product description)
2. cost(cost of the product)
3. date_of_pur(Date of Purchase) 

The CSV file must have this format so that we can add the details in the SALE model to show them in the dashboard and do the CRUD operation on the enteries.
